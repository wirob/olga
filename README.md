# Olga

A Python api for naming your plant, maybe some AI to help suggesting a name for it.

# Getting started

## Pre-req's

- Python3
- Flask

## Local development

To run the app, make sure all pre-req's are installed.

You'll need to export the variable `FLASK_APP` before launching the server, after you have done so, you can launch the server:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=app.py
$ flask run
```
